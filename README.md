# twitch_to_m3u
m3u links of twitch streams for localhost

### How to use
> Edit the `autorun` (`.sh` for linux, `.bat` for windows) file, and change `127.0.0.1` to the IP of the device that you want to be the local server (eg.: `192.168.1.5`).

> Save the file

> Run `autorun`

> Add streams into the file `streams.txt`

> If the server IP is `192.168.1.5`, find the playlist at `192.168.1.5:9001/playlist.m3u`. Add this to tivimate (or any player that supports m3u)
